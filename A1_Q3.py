#Given a string "abc123" attempt to convert it to an integer. handle the exception if conversion fails. Why conversion fail and how it can be handled.

string_value = "abc123"

try:
    int_value = int(string_value)  # Attempt to convert the string to an integer
    print(int_value)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Conversion failed: {e}")  # Handle the exception if conversion fails

#Why the conversion fails?: 
#The string "abc123" contains both alphabetic characters (abc) and numeric characters (123).
#The int() function only works on strings that represent valid integers (e.g., "123", "-456"), 
#and it cannot handle mixed content like "abc123". Therefore, Python raises a ValueError.

#How it can be handled?: You can catch the ValueError using a try-except block, as shown in the code. 
#This allows you to gracefully handle the error instead of having the program crash. 
#You can also log or display an error message to indicate why the conversion failed.
